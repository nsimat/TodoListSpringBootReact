# TodoListSpringBootReact
This project is intended to create a ToList web application with Java, Spring Boot and React.
This project is about creating a Todo List web application with Spring Boot. I have created 
a REST API for creating Todo task and recording that task in a MySQL database. The REST API 
is used as a backend for a frontend written in React or Angular.
